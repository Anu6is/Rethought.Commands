# Rethought.Commands
The goal behind this project is to simplify the building of commands.
Commands are defined as simple actions that can be invoked with a context.
The context is a specified generic type argument.
An example could be context of a chat-application that contains the message,
the user and maybe a channel from which the message was sent.

To build commands you can use the fluent extensions or manually construct commands.
